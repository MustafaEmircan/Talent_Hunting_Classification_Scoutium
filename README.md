# üèÜ Talent_Hunting_Classification_Scoutium

## üéØ Business Problem
We need to predict which class (average, highlighted) the players are, based on the scores given to the attributes of the players monitored by the scouts.

## üìä About Dataset
The dataset consists of information from Scoutium, containing ratings of football players' attributes observed during matches and evaluated by scouts. 
The dataset is divided into two main parts: `scoutium_attributes`, which contains the attribute evaluations, and `scoutium_potential_labels`, 
which contains the final decision labels.
